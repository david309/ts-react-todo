# Todo App

A simple _todo_ application to keep track of what needs to be done.

## what is it?

I wanted to give Typescript a try and I hadn't used React in quite a while, so I made this. I took inspiration from the MDN [Svelte Todo App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started) and tried to implement all of the features it includes.

## what can it do?

- Create new todos
- Toggle completion status of a todo
- Edit a todo
- Delete a todo

### aditional information

The `Login` button/functionality is there because it's what I started off making to help familiarize myself with React and get Typescript figured out. I decided to leave it in because it might be fun to expand on this in the future.

Feel free to clone and mess around with this as you please.
